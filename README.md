    <h1>Daikin2MQTT  ðŸŒ‰</h1>
    <p>
        Allows you to use your Daikin devices <b>with</b> Cloud Onecta.
    </p>
    <p>
        It bridges events and allows you to control your Daikin devices via MQTT. In this way you can integrate your Daikin devices with whatever smart home infrastructure you are using.

## Integrations
Daikin2MQTT integrates well with (almost) every home automation solution because it uses MQTT. However the following integrations are worth mentioning:

### Developing
Daikin2MQTT uses TypeScript. Therefore after making changes to files in the `src/` directory you need to recompile Daikin2MQTT.
